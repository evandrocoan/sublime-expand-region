# ExpandRegion for Sublime Text

### Like "Expand Selection to Scope". But better!

ExpandRegion works a bit like the build in "Expand Selection to Scope", however it does not depend on Scopes (Scopes are used by ST to "understand" code, i.e. for syntax highlighting). Therefore selection expansion can be more granular and customizable.

It works similar to ExpandRegion for Emacs and "Structural Selection" (Control-W) in the JetBrains IDE's (i.e. IntelliJ IDEA).

## Prereleases

Pre-releases help us to test new features and improve the stability of releases. You can benefit the newest features and help us testing them. Just open *Preferences > Package Settings > Package Control > Settings - User* and insert at a reasonable (correct JSON syntax) position:

``` js
    "install_prereleases": ["ExpandRegion"],
```

If you also use pre-releases of other packages just add them comma separated into the list.


## Installation

### By Package Control

1. Download & Install **`Sublime Text 3`** (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Install Package Control`**, then,
   wait few seconds until the installation finishes up
1. Now,
   Go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Add Channel`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
   ```
1. Go to the menu **`Tools -> Command Palette...
   (Ctrl+Shift+P)`**
1. Type **`Preferences:
   Package Control Settings â€“ User`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
   find the following setting on your **`Package Control.sublime-settings`** file:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
       ],
   ```
1. And,
   change it to the following, i.e.,
   put the **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line as first:
   ```js
       "channels":
       [
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json",
           "https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json",
       ],
   ```
   * The **`https://raw.githubusercontent...`** line must to be added before the **`https://packagecontrol.io...`** one, otherwise,
     you will not install this forked version of the package,
     but the original available on the Package Control default channel **`https://packagecontrol.io...`**
1. Now,
   go to the menu **`Preferences -> Package Control`**
1. Type **`Install Package`** on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then,
search for **`ExpandRegion`** and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>

## Using

- Set a shortcut.
  Open "Key Bindings - User" and add to following line:
``` js
{ "keys": ["super+shift+space"], "command": "expand_region" },
{
  "keys": ["super+u"],
  "command": "expand_region",
  "args": {"undo": true},
  "context": [{ "key": "expand_region_soft_undo" }]
},
```
Note: third party plugins can not properly hook into the history. So soft-undo in basically only a undo expand selection. Soft-redo will not work.


## Develop

## Background

This plugin is inspired by the amazing [expand-region for Emacs](https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el).

Here a video showing this feature (in Emacs):
